website viewing product details and product item that's come to website first in the use of schema.

-> schema in wordpress: 
youst then go general -> then configure wizard
-> if your site is like online shop then it will generates json LD code automatically. 
if we go to product website source page then we can see an script that are automatically generates by the youst seo. 

-> if we want to genatate a code that is static ;
 then go to search console.
-> before going to search console you have to copy that site address;
-> go to legacy tools and report
-> then go to web tools
-> go to testing tools

if code is already ccreated you can verify that code by structred data testing tools.
-> paste and run code. 
-> you can see many warning that's need to sesolve and finout the errror

-> if you chosse second option then go to structred option. 
-> data markup helper: 
select the item catagories and start tagging. 

it's an importan issues that if we use youst seo it will generates and again 
if we make code and submit it on the deshboard pannel then therre will 
be showing manay warning and error.
because of duplicate code .

how can we eleminate that?
